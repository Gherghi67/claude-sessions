# True when a transcript shares the session's project dir without being a
# conversation of the session: an agent-team teammate's, or a headless run's.
# A teammate started with the session as its working directory
# writes a top-level transcript into the same project dir as the lead, so the
# filename cannot tell them apart — and it is routinely the newest, because the
# teammate outlives the turn that spawned it.
#
# What separates them is WHERE the teammate frame appears, not whether it does.
# A teammate's brief IS its first user turn. A lead that merely receives
# teammate reports carries the same frame mid-file, because Claude Code injects
# an inbound message as "Another Claude session sent a message:
# <teammate-message ...>" — so testing the whole file would classify every
# team-using lead as a teammate, which is exactly the population this serves.
#
# Reads the file directly rather than `head -c N | grep -q`: an early-exiting
# pipe consumer SIGPIPEs its producer, and transcripts run to megabytes. `-m1`
# also stops at the first user turn instead of scanning a whole transcript to
# prove a marker absent.
#
# A headless run is the other occupant of the project dir: an Agent SDK call
# or a `claude -p` with the session as its working directory. Claude Code stamps
# every user line with the entrypoint that produced it, and the headless ones
# seen so far all begin `sdk-` (`sdk-py`, and `sdk-cli` for `claude -p`), while a
# person's conversation reads `cli` or `claude-desktop`. Measured over 5522
# transcripts on one machine: 4670 began headless, 842 `cli`, 6 `claude-desktop`.
#
# The first line alone does not settle it: `claude --resume` on a run a script
# started makes it a person's conversation, first line unchanged. So a file is a
# headless run only when it opens with an `sdk-` entrypoint AND no later user
# line carries a different value (any string that does not start `sdk-`, the
# empty string included). An opening line with no entrypoint at all, or one
# with a value Claude Code has not invented yet, counts as a conversation
# (unless that value itself begins `sdk-`): a
# wrongly skipped conversation leaves a session resuming nothing, which is
# worse than a wrongly named one. The second read happens only for files that
# open headless; a purely headless one is read to its end. The prompt text
# shares the line with the field, but JSON escapes its quotes, so a prompt that
# quotes the pattern cannot match it.
